						<p>Dave and Nicky are getting married. Hurrah!</p>
						<p>And if you're here you must be invited to the whole shebang! Right, so this is what you need to know...</p>
						<p>Please be at <a href="#">St George In The East Church</a> by 12.40am on 23rd April 2016. Here is how you find it:</p>
						<p>The church is going to be a bit of a squeeze, so suggest you get there early if you want a good spot.</p>
						<p>Next stop: <a href="#">Limehouse Town Hall</a>. Please arrive here at 3pm. This is where it is:</p>
						<p>Word of warning: we're putting this all on ourselves, so please don't expect a polished operation. In fact, everything could go horribly wrong... So, in the event of a disaster/mishap please grin and bear it. Or just get so horribly drunk that it doesn't matter any more.</p>
						<p>We've put together an <a href="#fag">FAQ</a> here but if we've missed anything, please give us a shout here. Oh, and here is where you ramp if you haven't already.</p>
						<p>Thank you again for agreeing to be part of our special day. It means a lot that you're coming along.</p>
						<p>See you there!</p>
						<p>Dave and Nicky xxx</p>

						<p>First of all - we want to say that you absolutely do not have to give us a present. You joining us on our special day (which we appreciate is probably tiresome and costly for a lot of you!) is a gift enough.</p>
						<p>But if you do want to give us a gift, we thought it would make life a little easier if we put together some options for you to choose from:</p>
						<ul class="bulleted">
							<li>A bottle of gin - need we say more?</li>
							<li>Zara homeware reed diffusers. Because, our house smells of cat otherwise.</li>
							<li>A plant.</li>
							<li>Fancy candles. Again, because we smell.</li>
							<li>Taxidermy - because Nicky is writing this list.</li>
							<li>A contribution towards our honeymoon fund.</li>
							<li>Tea towels.</li>
							<li>New socks for Dave (size 12).</li>
							<li>Groupon Vouchers - so that we can have lots of adventures.</li>
							<li>A drawing of a cat.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>We have also put a list of larger items here in case people want to team up and buy a joint present / would prefer to buy something at a click of a button.</p>
